// Build-time only. Renders one public marketing route to a static HTML
// string, for scripts/prerender.mjs to inject into the built dist/<route>/
// index.html, so a crawler that never runs JavaScript still sees real
// content in the bytes it fetches (see the geo-content-optimization skill:
// "is the content in the served HTML" is the first thing to check, and this
// SPA previously failed it: the raw response was ~49 words).
//
// None of these pages call an API (confirmed: no useQuery/API import in the
// marketing tree), so this needs no QueryClientProvider and no real backend,
// just a Router context for the <Link>/useLocation calls inside them.
